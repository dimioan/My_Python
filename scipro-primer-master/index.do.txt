TITLE: Resources for A Primer on Scientific Programming with Python
AUTHOR: Hans Petter Langtangen Email:hpl@simula.no

======= The 4th edition =======

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Scientific-Programming-Computational-Science-Engineering/dp/3642549586/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1407225588&sr=1-2&keywords=langtangen"><img border="0" width="130" src="figs/Primer4th_pic.jpg"></a>


===== All programs from the book =====

On Unix/Linux or Mac, download
the tarfile "`book-examples-4th.tar.gz`": "book-examples-4th.tar.gz"
for the 4th edition and pack it out by

!bc sys
tar xvzf book-examples-4th.tar.gz
!ec
On Windows, download "`book-examples-4th.zip`": "book-examples-4th.zip"
for the 4th edition and pack it out by

!bc sys
unzip book-examples-4th.zip
!ec
or double click on the file icon.

The result is a folder (directory)
tree `src` with subfolders containing
the program examples for different chapters in the book
(`formulas`, `looplist`, etc., as explained in the introduction to
each chapter).

You can also directly access the latest version of the example
files at "GitHub": "https://github.com/hplgit/scipro-primer", see
the "src": "https://github.com/hplgit/scipro-primer/tree/master/src"
directory (to download a file, click the *Raw* button on the right first
to get the pure text file in the browser and then right-click to download).
To copy the whole repository to your computer, run

!bc sys
git clone https://github.com/hplgit/scipro-primer.git
!ec

===== Erratalist =====

Here is a "PDF file": "erratalist4th.pdf" or an "HTML file":
"erratalist4th.html" with an errata list for the
4th edition of the book. If you find any typo or error, please
report it to "the author": "mailto:hpl@simula.no".

===== Software installation =====

There are several ways to access Python, either on your computer or
in the cloud. "Appendix H.1": "http://hplgit.github.io/edu/accesspy/accesspy_primer4.html" in the book gives an overview of
recommended technologies and how to use them to get the software you need
for working with the book. Our primary recommendation is to install Anaconda - it suffices for the book. However, if you intend to do more advanced
scientific computing in the future, we strongly recommend to use a virtual
Ubuntu machine for all that work.

__SciTools.__
The package SciTools is freqently referred to and used in the book.
You may want to install SciTools directly from its Git version control
repository. This makes it easy to upgrade the package at any time.
SciTools is now hosted at "GitHub": "https://github.com/hplgit/scitools/"
(note that the old repository at Googlecode only contains old versions - stay
away from those!).
Make sure you have the Git (<tt>hg</tt>) version control system
on your computer (if not, googling for installation of Git brings you
to simple procedures, depending on the platform you are on).
Get the SciTools source code and install it by

!bc sys
git clone https://github.com/hplgit/scitools.git
cd scitools
sudo python setup.py install
!ec
Whenever you want to upgrade the package, just go to the `scitools`
folder and run the commands

!bc sys
git pull origin master
sudo python setup.py install
!ec

A simpler installation procedure applies `pip`:

!bc sys
pip install -e git+https://github.com/hplgit/scitools.git#egg=scitools --upgrade
!ec
Note that you have to rerun this command to install new versions of SciTools
in the future.

===== Software installation on Ubuntu =====

If you have an Ubuntu installation, Python is already there. The minimum
extra packages are installed by this command:

!bc sys
sudo apt-get install python-matplotlib python-scipy python-gnuplot gnuplot gnuplot-x11 python-scitools
!ec
The Gnuplot packages are optional (you can exclusively used Matplotlib instead).

A comprehensive installation with lots of useful packages can be
performed by a "Bash script": "https://raw.github.com/hplgit/vagrantbox/master/doc/src/vagrant/src-vagrant/install_rich.sh". Download this file (`install_rich.sh`) and run it by `bash install_rich.sh`.

===== Slides =====

There is a "slide collection": "slides/index.html"
from lectures based on the book.

======= The 3rd edition =======

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Scientific-Programming-Computational-Science-Engineering/dp/3642302920/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1344338912&sr=8-4&keywords=langtangen+primer"><img border="0" width="130" src="figs/Primer_pic.jpg"></a>

===== All programs from the book =====

On Unix/Linux or Mac, download
the tarfile "`book-examples-3rd.tar.gz`": "book-examples-3rd.tar.gz"
for the 3rd edition and pack it out by

!bc sys
tar xvzf book-examples-3rd.tar.gz
!ec
On Windows, download "`book-examples-3rd.zip`": "book-examples-3rd.zip"
for the 3rd edition and pack it out by

!bc sys
unzip book-examples-3rd.zip
!ec
or double click on the file icon.

The result is a folder (directory)
tree `src` with subfolders containing
the program examples for different chapters in the book
(`formulas`, `looplist`, etc., as explained in the introduction to
each chapter).

You can also directly access the latest version of the example
files at "GitHub": "https://github.com/hplgit/scipro-primer", see
the "src-3rd": "https://github.com/hplgit/scipro-primer/tree/master/src-3rd"
directory (to download a file, click the *Raw* button on the right first
to get the pure text file in the browser and then right-click to download).
To copy the whole repository to your computer, run

!bc sys
git clone https://github.com/hplgit/scipro-primer.git
!ec


===== Software installation =====

The "old software description": "install.html" is now outdated, so we
refer to the "new one": "http://hplgit.github.io/edu/accesspy/accesspy_primer4.html" that appears in the 4th edition.

You may want to install SciTools directly from its Mercurial version control
repository. This makes it easy to upgrade the package at any time.
SciTools is hosted at "Googlecode": "https://github.com/hplgit/scitools/".
Make sure you have the Mercurial (<tt>hg</tt>) version control system
on your computer (if not, do `sudo pip install mercurial` on Linux or Mac,
and `pip install mercurial` in a Windows Command Prompt or Power Shell window).
Get the SciTools source code and install it by

!bc sys
hg clone https://langtangen@code.google.com/p/scitools/
cd scitools
sudo python setup.py install
!ec
Whenever you want to upgrade the package, just go to the `scitools`
folder and run the commands

!bc sys
hg pull
hg update
sudo python setup.py install
!ec

===== Software installation on Ubuntu =====

If you have an Ubuntu installation, Python is already there. The minimum
extra packages are installed by this command:

!bc sys
sudo apt-get install python-matplotlib python-scipy python-gnuplot gnuplot gnuplot-x11 python-scitools

performed by a "Bash script": "https://raw.github.com/hplgit/vagrantbox/master/doc/src/vagrant/src-vagrant/install_rich.sh". Download this file (`install_rich.sh`) and run it by `bash install_rich.sh`.

===== Erratalist =====

There is a "PDF file": "erratalist3rd.pdf" with an errata list for the
3rd edition of the book.

===== Slides =====

There is a "slide collection": "http://www.ifi.uio.no/~inf1100/slides"
from lectures based on the 3rd edition of the book.

======= The 1st and 2nd edition =======

The resource page for the first two editions is located
"elsewhere": "http://vefur.simula.no/intro-programming".
